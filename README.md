# Template for Wordpress workflow with grunt, Git and Sass, Compass and Susy responsivce framework

![Template for Wordpress workflow with grunt, Git and Sass, Compass and Susy responsivce framewor](img.jpg)

This is my template for developing  Wordpress theme with Sass and runing Grunt task runner for compiling scss into css. Grunt compile your Sass into css, and use autoprefixer to add browser prefixes to your css. Then compress your Sass file for lower file size and faster load time. We use underscore starter theme for building custom wordpress themes.
